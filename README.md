# OpenGL
An OpenGL program that demonstrates particle movement in various containers


This simple OpenGL program displays how particle movement takes place in containers of different shapes. A keyboard function is used to change the shapes of the container, and a list based mouse function is used to provide various options such as changing the size, number and speed of the particles.

This project has been tested on Linux systems that have the necessary OpenGL libraries, and also on the CodeBlocks IDE.
Portability to other systems is not a issue, provided a few minor modifications are made.
